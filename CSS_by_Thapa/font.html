        The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. It
        wore those scars with pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence
        rather than diminishing it. The scars gave it character and had not
        overwhelmed to the point that it had become ratty. The jacket was in its
        prime and it knew it. The light was out on the front porch of the house.
        This was strange. Judy couldn't remember a time when she had ever seen
        it out. She hopped out of her car and walked to the door. It was
        slightly ajar and she knew this meant something terrible. She gently
        pushed the door open and hall her fears were realized. "Surprise! Happy
        Birthday!" everyone shouted. The alarm went off at exactly 6:00 AM as it
        had every morning for the past five years. Barbara began her morning and
        was ready to eat breakfast by 7:00 AM. The day appeared to be as normal
        as any other, but that was about to change. In fact, it was going to
        change at exactly 7:23 AM.
