    <h1>About Boat Mystery</h1>
    <p>
      There was a leak in the boat. Nobody had yet noticed it, and nobody would
      for the next couple of hours. This was a problem since the boat was
      heading out to sea and while the leak was quite small at the moment, it
      would be much larger when it was ultimately discovered. John had planned
      it exactly this way. Turning away from the ledge, he started slowly down
      the mountain, deciding that he would, that very night, satisfy his
      curiosity about the man-house. In the meantime, he would go down into the
      canyon and get a cool drink, after which he would visit some berry patches
      just over the ridge, and explore among the foothills a bit before his
      nap-time, which always came just after the sun had walked past the middle
      of the sky. At that period of the day the sunâ€™s warm rays seemed to cast a
      sleepy spell over the silent mountainside, so all of the animals, with one
      accord, had decided it should be the hour for their mid-day sleep.
