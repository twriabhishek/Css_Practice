        >Wandering down the path to the pond had become a daily routine. Even
        when the weather wasn't cooperating like today with the wind and rain,
        Jerry still took the morning stroll down the path until he reached the
        pond. Although there didn't seem to be a particular reason Jerry did
        this to anyone looking in from the outside, those who knew him well knew
        exactly what was going on. It could all be traced back to a specific
        incident that happened exactly 5 years previously.</p
